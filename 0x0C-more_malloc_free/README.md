## This code is the solution for more malloc and free tasks given by ALX SE program.The tasks are as follows:
0. write a function named by maloc_checked, that allocates memory using malloc.
1. write a function named by string_nconcat, that concatinates two string.
2. write a function named by _calloc , that allcocateds memory for an array, using malloc.
3. write a function named by array_range, that creates an array of integers.

## The previous 4 tasks are mandatory tasks while the next two are advance one.
4. write a function named by _realloc, that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.
5. write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
