## This is malloc and free functions tasks
#malloc and free are functions that are used in dynamic memory allocation.
#malloc is equivalent function with new operator in c++ and free is equivalent with that of delete operator in c++.
#malloc is to allocate memory while free is to deallocate the allocated memory.
#This code provides you the solution for the project on malloc and free tasks given by ALX SE program. The tasks are as follows:
0. write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
1. write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
2. write a function the concatinates two strings.
3. write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of intigers.
4. write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid fuction.
